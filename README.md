## Recommendations
![](https://www.opendoor.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sell-home-raleigh-infographic.jpg)
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
 
    I would recommend adding virtual or 3D tours for customers who are not able to visit the homes in person.
 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
 
    Adding virtual/3D tours enhances the visual imagery of a home and will give customers extra confidence in your business. Virtual tours would allow people who are relocating to a new area the ability to guide themselves from the comfort of their own home without the hassle of traveling and booking many tours. 
 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
 
    * High-resolution 360-degree camera
    * Virtual tour software
    * Cloud-based Server
 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
 
    Photographers use High-Resolution cameras with special lenses and pre-programmed settings that provide industry-leading quality for still images and a 360 panorama viewer. Through hosting on Amazon Web Cloud Services they would be using rich content builders such as Java applet or Adobe Flash.
